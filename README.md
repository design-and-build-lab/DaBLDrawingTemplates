Modifiable template files for design drawings.

## Overview

The Design and Build Lab (DaBL) is a digital fabrication and rapid prototyping space that specializes in teaching students, staff, and faculty to create things to solve problems. One of the most powerful tools of the space is computer aided design (CAD). This is very useful in creating digital objects that can be sent to a machine for manufacturing. As such, the space regularly teaches workshops on these programs such as Fusion 360, Eagle, etc. One important feature in reproducability is proper documentation. Addititionally, it can be used to showcase ones work. As such, we seek to teach members to create proper design drawing for such purposes. 


## Purpose

This repository serves to provide relevant template files to be used in CAD drawings. Templates files are currently limited to the following programs :
	
	- [Fusion 360](Fusion360/README.md for three-dimensional design.


Additionally, title block files can be found in the repective folder in different file formats for other programs.
